This is an opensource map I made at SRP to map construction 
jobs from a schedule converted to plain text. The source 
code is all opensource and working, but the offical data is
omitted [classified] and therefore randomly generated for this example
using a java program in the project root. The map base layer is
also not included so I added openstreet maps as a base layer.
The maps is built with javascript using the opensource leaflet library.
The coordinates are generated as a seperate js file with a c++ 
text parser program I wrote. Java>txt>c++>JS   lolgen.

There is a print button and it sort of works but it does some wacky
stuff because of zoom level. I never could get it to work perfectly
for an end user... but you can get a map print if you tinker with it.

This map was made with the help of opensource projects:
Leaflet: a maping java script library
Openstreet maps: opensource world maping project
