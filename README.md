This is an opensource map I made at SRP to map construction 
jobs from a schedule converted to plain text. The source 
code is all opensource and working, but the offical data is
omitted [classified] and therefore randomly generated for this example
using a java program in the project root. The map base layer is
also not included so I replaced it with one from openstreet maps
The maps is built with javascript using the opensource leaflet library.
The coordinates are generated as a seperate js file with a c++ 
text parser program I wrote. Java>txt>c++>JS lolgen.
